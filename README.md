# BloodBridge – A Smart Blood Bank Management System

BloodBridge is a full-stack web application built with **Flask**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **SQL** to efficiently manage blood donations, donor data, and blood inventory for hospitals and blood banks.

The system offers real-time inventory tracking, donor search, and request submission features, making the blood donation process faster, more transparent, and more efficient.<img width="1907" height="895" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-13 203335" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48ff6366-f62c-49d7-82b4-29880afa3f59" />
